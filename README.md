# Project Overview

Welcome to the **Writing-a-C-Compiler-Writeup** repository! This project is dedicated to summarizing and analyzing the contents of the book. The project is divided into three main sections:

1. **Book Notes**
2. **Code Analysis**
3. **Progressive Implementation**

## Book Notes

The `BOOK_NOTES.md` file contains summarized notes from the book, highlighting key concepts, strategies for each chapter, and provided pseudocode. This document serves as a quick reference guide to the important points covered in the book.

For detailed notes and pseudocode, refer to [BOOK_NOTES.md](BOOK_NOTES.md).

## Code Analysis

The `code_analysis` folder focuses on analyzing the implementation code that accompanies the book: [nqcc2](https://github.com/nlsandler/nqcc2). This section delves into the practical application of the concepts discussed in the book, providing insights into the implementation details and identifying any gaps between the pseudocode and the actual code.

Explore the in-depth code analysis in the [code_analysis](code_analysis/) folder.

## Implementation

The `code` folder contains the C++ code implementations for the book's concepts. For each chapter, a snapshot of the current code is copied to the `progressive_implementation/chapter_{number}` folder. This allows for offline comparison of the code's evolution across chapters, without relying on git compare.

Explore the C++ code implementations in the [code](code/) folder.

Track the progressive implementation snapshots in the [progressive_implementation](progressive_implementation/) folder.
